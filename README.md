# Google Play Data Analysis 📱📊

## Overview
This project analyzes the Google Play Store dataset (`gps.csv`) to uncover insights about app categories, installations, ratings, and other factors influencing app performance. Using Python and Jupyter Notebook, this analysis leverages libraries such as **Pandas**, **Seaborn**, and **Matplotlib** for data manipulation and visualization.

The analysis is presented in the **[Play_Store Analysis.ipynb](https://github.com/mercydeez/Google-Play-Analysis/blob/main/Play_Store%20Analysis%20.ipynb)** notebook, where you can follow along with the code and explore the visualizations.

## Dataset 📂
The dataset used for this analysis is **gps.csv**, which contains data on various apps in the Google Play Store. It includes information about:
- **App Name**: Name of the app
- **Category**: Category the app belongs to (e.g., Game, Productivity, Social)
- **Installs**: Number of installs (in millions)
- **Rating**: Average rating of the app
- **Reviews**: Number of reviews the app has received
- **Size**: Size of the app (in MB)
- **Price**: Price of the app (if any)
- **Genres**: Genres associated with the app

## Key Insights 🔑
- 🚀 Analyzed the distribution of apps across different categories.
- 📈 Visualized the most popular app categories by installations.
- 🔍 Identified trends and patterns related to app ratings and performance.
- 🎮 Investigated the top apps in the most popular categories.  and also can do changes
- 💡 Explored correlations between ratings, reviews, and number of installs.

## Visualizations 📊
The project includes various visualizations to showcase the findings:
- **Pie Chart** 🍰: Shows the distribution of apps across different categories.
- **Bar Chart Subplots** 📊: Displays the top 5 apps from the most popular categories, using multiple bar charts in a subplot layout.
- **KDE Plot** 📉: Visualizes the distribution of app ratings and installs using kernel density estimation (KDE).
- **Histograms** 🧑‍💻: Plots the distribution of ratings and reviews to understand the spread of the data.

## Technologies Used ⚙️
- 🐍 **Python** (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- 📓 **Jupyter Notebook** (The analysis is available in the **[Play_Store Analysis.ipynb](https://github.com/mercydeez/Google-Play-Analysis/blob/main/Play_Store%20Analysis%20.ipynb)** notebook)
