# Google Play Data Analysis 📱📊

## Overview
This project analyzes the Google Play Store dataset to uncover insights about app categories, installations, ratings, and more. Using Python and Jupyter Notebook, this analysis utilizes libraries such as Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib to process and visualize the data.

The analysis is presented in the **[Play_Store Analysis.ipynb](Play_Store%20Analysis.ipynb)** notebook, where you can follow along with the code and explore the visualizations.

## Key Insights
- 🚀 Analyzed the distribution of apps across different categories.
- 📈 Visualized the most popular app categories by installations.
- 🔍 Identified trends and patterns related to app ratings and performance.

## Visualizations
This project includes the following types of visualizations:
- **Pie Chart** 🍰: Displays the distribution of apps across categories.
- **Bar Chart Subplots** 📊: Shows the top 5 apps for each of the most popular categories, using multiple bar charts in a subplot layout.
- **KDE Plot** 📉: Shows the kernel density estimation (KDE) for app ratings and installations, allowing us to understand the distribution more clearly.
